*ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS*

Developing an **AI chatbot with NLP** involves multiple stages, including **data collection, preprocessing, model training, and deployment**. The chatbot is designed to **understand, process, and generate human-like responses** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques**. The process begins with **data collection** from sources like customer support logs and chatbot datasets. The data undergoes **preprocessing**, including **tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, and Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to improve accuracy. The chatbot model can be **rule-based, retrieval-based, or generative**, with modern chatbots leveraging **deep learning models** like **GPT, BERT, or Transformer-based architectures** for better **context understanding**. The **training process** involves feeding the model with large datasets and fine-tuning it for **intent recognition and sentiment analysis**. A **dialog management system** ensures smooth conversation flow by maintaining **context, slot filling, and user intent handling**. For **voice-based interactions**, integration with **Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems** is required. After training, the chatbot undergoes rigorous **testing**, including **unit testing, integration testing, and user feedback analysis**, before **deployment** on platforms like **websites, mobile apps, and messaging services (WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger)**. Post-deployment, chatbot performance is continuously improved using **machine learning techniques, reinforcement learning, and error handling**. AI-powered chatbots are transforming **customer service, healthcare, education, and e-commerce**, providing **efficient, scalable, and intelligent** conversational experiences. With **advancements in deep learning, AI, and cloud computing**, the future of **AI chatbots** will include **multimodal interactions, emotional intelligence, and enhanced personalization**, making them an essential part of digital communication.
